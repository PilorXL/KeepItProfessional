<div class = "bodyText"><p>Let's make a list now! 
<br>We begin by using the "ul" tag for unordered and "li" for each list item. 
<br>The "ol" tag is the ordered list. We would also use "li" for each list item.
<br>The main difference is ordered uses numbers whereas unordered uses bullet points.
<br>To demonstrate this: 
<br>
</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    </ol>
<p>This is an unordered list:
</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
    </ul>
